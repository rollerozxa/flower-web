<span class="title">Stars Exchange</span>

<p>The Stars Exchange is a place where you can exchange between seeds and stars.</p>

<p>You can either choose to BUY <span class="starc">Stars</span> using <span class="seedc">Seeds</span> or to SELL <span class="starc">Stars</span> for <span class="seedc">Seeds</span>. This is because <span class="starc">Stars</span> are considered to be a more valuable currency than <span class="seedc">Seeds</span>.</p>

<p>The price to buy and sell <span class="starc">Stars</span> wildly varies depending on the supply and demand of the currencies.</p>

<p>And that's it. You can either go to the next part or you can solve this simple math problem:</p>
