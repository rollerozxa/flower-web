<p>To make your flower grow, it needs water and sun. If it has no water, your flower will shrink. If it has no sun, it'll "sleep" and it won't shrink no matter what. If you donâ€™t want your flower to shrink when the sun is up, you can buy the "Do not shrink" item at the bottom of the Items page.</p>
