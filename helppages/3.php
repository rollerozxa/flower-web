<span class="title">3. Warp & more!</span>

<p>This will go through the rest of the items you can buy for your flower.</p>

<span class="title">Warp</span>

<p>Normally, your resources depletes and your flower grows in real time, for example, if you check on your flower exactly 1 hour later, your flower has exactly 1 hour less water.</p>

<p>However, when you have warp (also known as time warp), time goes 750 times as fast. This means that your flower grows 750 times as fast... and your resources deplete 750 times as fast, <strong>including time warp.</strong> This means that as long as you have more water and sun than warp, your flower won't run out of resources while warping.</p>

<span class="title">Bulk items</span>

<p>Bulk items give all of your flowers X hours of warp, sun, giga and warp. Now you may be thinking "Oh great, this is probably cheaper!", but that might not be the case. </p>

<p><span class="math">( ( ( ( 20x + 50x ) / y ) + 2x + 4x ) * z )</span> would be a math expression of the cost of buying the stuff separated, not using bulk items. The variables can be explained as such:</p>

<ul class="nobreak">
	<li>x = Hours of each resource bought.</li>
	<li>y = Cost of selling one star in the stars exchange.</li>
	<li>z = Amount of flowers you currently have.</li>
</ul>

<p>For an example, let's say we're buying 5000 hours of water, sun, warp and giga for all of our flowers. Then the variables could be defined as such:</p>

<ul class="nobreak">
	<li>x = 5000</li>
	<li>y = 50</li>
	<li>z = 5</li>
</ul>

<p>This would mean the calculation would be <span class="math">( ( ( ( 20 * 5000 + 50 * 5000 ) / 50 ) + 2 * 5000 + 4 * 5000) * 5 )</span>, which turns out to be 185000. I would therefor have to spend 185000 stars to buy 5000 hours of water, sun, giga and warp. Look over to the price of bulk items and it turns out that it's 25000 stars more expensive.</p>

<p>Well, this is where bulk discount comes into the picture. On the 31st day of every month, the bulk gets discounted by 25%. That means that it won't happen in months where there isn't a 31st day. This would make the bulk items 35000 stars cheaper.</p>
