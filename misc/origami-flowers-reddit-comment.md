> OMG I just stumbled upon this post randomly while searching for the game. It's been so many years since it shut down (late 2017-early 2018 it must have been), but every now and then I like to see if there is anyone online reminiscing about it. This must have been the first time I see anyone talking about it! As such I _have_ to dump some words on it, seeing as how much I have been sitting on about it for so long without ever mentioning anything publicly.

> I played it on-and-off going back many years, probably going back as far as 2011 something too. It was a sad day when Adam shut it down, but it was understandable I suppose. The game was way past its peak and he had a falling out with Tapjoy several years prior that which basically led to him not being able to make any revenue from the game anymore at that point AFAIK.

> Behind the simple looking frontpage of the game it was really oozing with charm from the community and the chatterbox. The plush moderator icon, the squirrel-octopus-chimpanzee in-joke, the humourous abbreviation expansions (e.g. ROFL -> Rolling on the flower laughing, and SMH -> Soggy morning haggis), the whole crazy flower galaxy thing where all purchases would go towards constructing parts of a galaxy and then when the whole community finishes building a galaxy the game would just go haywire. Good times...

> I keep having dreams every now and then about the game coming back in some way or the other, or there being something different showing up on the website, but that hasn't happened. 00adam.com, the website where the game's server was hosted on has been down ever since the shutdown, though he's still renewing the domain interestingly enough.

> I don't think I know about any games that are like it. I was trying to recreate the server for the game in 2019 but didn't go very far. I was young and inexperienced with everything at the time, and the game was mostly a browser game beyond the main screen (the app itself didn't have much and most stuff was happening on the server), but I got it to launch again and reimplemented some very rudimentary parts of the game.

> It's been so many years though and I've mostly archived away everything related to the project, however I should have it somewhere. If I were to pick it back up now for anything other than a nostalgic novelty I would probably just make something new from the ground up, but I don't have any plans for doing something like that at the moment.
